        <h2>Wastewater Collections:</h2>
        <p>
          Wastewater collections systems are comprised of gravity pipes,
          manholes, tanks, lift stations, control structures, and force mains
          that gather used water from residential and nonresidential customers
          and convey the flow to the wastewater treatment plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wastewater Collections Operators perform skilled construction, repair,
          and maintenance of wastewater system facilities. They operate a
          variety of power equipment and ensure public health by preventing
          sewage overflows and blockages.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wastewater collection system is a network of pipes, manholes, tanks,
          lift stations, control structures, and force mains. It gathers used
          water from residential and nonresidential customers and conveys it to
          a wastewater treatment plant for processing and disposal. These
          systems play a crucial role in maintaining public health and
          environmental quality by managing sewage effectively.

        <h2>Water Distribution:</h2>
        <p>
          Public water systems depend on distribution systems to provide an
          uninterrupted supply of pressurized safe drinking water to all
          consumers. Distribution system mains carry water from either: the
          treatment plant to the consumer; or the source to the consumer when
          treatment is absent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operate and maintain water distribution systems, including pumps,
          valves, and meters, to ensure the continuous supply of water to
          residential, commercial, and industrial users. Monitor system water
          pressure and adjust pumps and valves as necessary to maintain
          specified levels and ensure the integrity of water supply.
        </p>
        <p>
          A water distribution system is a crucial part of a water supply
          network. It consists of pipelines, storage facilities, pumps, and
          other components that transport potable water from centralized
          treatment plants or wells to consumers.
